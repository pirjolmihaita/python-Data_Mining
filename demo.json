I hear that line a lot: 'Me, I'm just another white guy.' Here's a solution: Try being a funnier white guy.\nI had such a fun time reading this book! Dear Girls was given to me as a gift and, at first, I wasn't sure how much it was really my thing, or even if I was going to read it. I like Ali Wong's stand-up just fine, but I don't read many books by comedians (just Born a Crime, which you definitely should read). Also, I say I like Ali Wong because I love how she tells really relatable stories and doesn't sugarcoat them with nice words, but I'm also not a huge fan of crude humour. Look, I grew up in Yorkshire where everyone has a crude sense of humour. In the beautiful land of God‚Äôs Own County, you might hear a passing child yell something about ‚Äúp***y‚Äù (I‚Äôm only sorta joking). I'm immune to it at this point.But, you know, this book was really entertaining and surprisingly sweet and heartwarming (in a hilarious way). Wong writes the book as a series of letters to her young daughters-- about life, love, sex, dating, careers, motherhood, and being East Asian. It's a good one of those funny-serious books in that she's talking about important things but is determined to never lose her sense of humour or trim her hairy bush. As we say in Yorkshire, \"good lass\".What Ali Wong does is normalize all the gross and embarrassing stuff that many people do but won't talk about: fart during yoga, grow a huge forest in the pubic region, date multiple guys who lose their erections... it's quite refreshing.Sometimes it seems like Ali Wong is fearless because her comedy is so without inhibition, but she also confesses to her own worries and fears and failures in this book. She leaves her daughters with a powerful message (though they are going to cringe so hard when they finally read this, lol) that it's okay to fail, to mess up, to sleep with the wrong person, to pick yourself up again and laugh about it. How wonderful that these girls have a mother behind them who is simultaneously so strong AND willing to be vulnerable.Oh, and the food. All the talk of delicious food in this book made me so hungry ü§§Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube\n...more"

Her book, written is a series of letters to her children, provides honest advice on men and marriage. She challenges working women stereotypes, embraces her Asian culture and doesn't back down from a frank sex talk.We learn how Ali began her career in San Francisco Bay comedy scene before moving to New York. However, that was no picnic. She ran herself ragged sprinting from comedy show to comedy show, auditioning for TV and eventually breaking out in the standup scene. She eventually meets her husband and knew it was true love from their very first yoga session together.\nIt's always challenging not to fart during yoga, but that day, I clenched my cheeks extra tight...\nAnd, (of course) she writes down any and all advice she has for her two children.\nThat became my mantra for motherhood from there on out.You have suffered enough.\nAll in all, this was a really, really good book!A word of warning though - when I say she's unfiltered - I mean it. Don't go into this book expecting to make it through a chapter without talking either about sex, poop or afterbirth. I hadn't known too much about Ali, other than internet clips from her Baby Cobra special, when I went into this book.And now? I'm a fan. Her frank advice on life: \nIf you can make it easier, make it easier, and don't feel guilty about it \n really resonated with me. I loved how she embraces motherhood in a crude, crass way. I haven't had children, but even I know it's not all mommy-blogs and matching onesies. It's refreshing to have someone unapologetically laying it all on the line.If you're a fan of her comedy - or take-no-shit-hold-no-prisoners women - this book is for you!!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads\n...more"

How he would feel about his granddaughter talking about what she lusts after? How I obsess over the most trivial problems. How I make a living by talking about what I want. How people pay to see his granddaughter just talk. He‚Äôd probably think I was some sort of magician with ancient powers, derived from behaving very well in a past life. Or a witch, I guess. At the very least, he‚Äôd definitely have the opposite opinion of all those jealous-ass white male comedians who say things like ‚ÄòPeople only like your comedy because you‚Äôre female and a minority.‚Äô My grandpa would be like ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt believe people like your comedy! You‚Äôre a female and a minority.‚Äô‚ÄùI have heard of Ali Wong and have seen her referenced a few times, but have never seen any of her standup. So needless to say, I was leary about reading a memoir about her. This book was recommended to me by someone I trust or I would have never picked it up on my own. I usually like memoirs or biographies by people in the twilight years of their lives or, better yet, dead. I think that comes from being a completist. I want the whole story, not just the first third of someone‚Äôs life. So here I am writing a review of a memoir by a woman in her 30s. How extraordinary! What is more amazing is that I gave the book five stars. How is this possible?It is simply impossible not to. Anyone who knows me well has heard my diatribe about movies billed as comedies. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like to laugh. I find life a series of comedic events, but I like comedy that occurs naturally, and comedic movies always come across as forced comedy, which ultimately starts to feel flat and fake. I‚Äôm soon wishing I‚Äôd put in something like In Bruges, where a serious plot is frequently enlivened by comedic elements. So what I‚Äôm saying is that I‚Äôm a terrible risk for a book like this. Ali Wong chooses to write her book as a series of letters to her children. The title reflects that, but my first reaction is...I‚Äôm a guy, so she isn‚Äôt really interested in men reading this book. Won‚Äôt I feel like I‚Äôm peeping in on revealing secrets not intended for me? Of course, the whole idea of Ali Wong having a secret she hasn‚Äôt revealed to the world is rather hilarious. Though I do wonder what secret could possibly be so horrendously embarrassing that Wong would not use it for her stand-up comedy routine? So the title does throw me, but I quickly shake it off as I become caught up in her narrative. It isn‚Äôt long before I am thinking...don‚Äôt tell your daughters that! My lifetime of brainwashed conditioning showing itself, sporting a wagging finger and disapproving look. By the end of the book, I feel like Wong has taken a scrub brush of whitewash to those elements of my mind. Full disclosure: I did watch her ass wiggle as she scrubbed. I would apologize, but then she‚Äôd have to bring her scrub brush back to have another go. Reading this book is going to make you uncomfortable. It may even offend you, but keep reading because not only is it good to occasionally be uncomfortable, sometimes you also learn to reserve being offended for those things that most deserve it.I was about half way through the book when I decided to watch her Netflix special Baby Cobra. I wanted to put together the Ali Wong being revealed to me in the book with the stand up comedian and found that the honest evaluation of her lusts, wants, and defects were syncopatico. If there is pretense, it is well hidden.This woman is refreshingly uninhibited. To some that might be code for rude, but it is hard to consider this level of truth to be rude. While watching the special, I loved it when the camera would pan to the audience. Those sideways looks that couples were giving each other, the hand to the face as someone laughed at something they found to be embarrassingly true, and as her husband describes it, ‚Äúlaugh-so-hard-you-pee-reactions.‚Äù As compelling as it is to watch Ali‚Äôs physical reactions, it was equally fascinating to watch the crowd. If I ever attend one of her events, I‚Äôd be tempted to spend the entire skit turned around, observing the crowd. I sort of sprung Baby Cobra on my wife, no warning, no gentle explanations to prepare her for what she was about to see. She is frequently a test subject to gauge normal reactions to abnormal conditions. If I was laughing, I looked over at her so that I would laugh even harder. She was one of those audience members with her hand over her face as she chuckled. She laughed so hard at one time she had trouble breathing. I didn‚Äôt ask her if she had a pee reaction. My wife never sweats, but insists she only glistens, so her admitting to any ‚Äúvulgar‚Äù body reactions would be most unusual. The book is hilarious, but it is more than that. She talks a lot about the amount of hard work and dedication it takes to make it as a comedian. She often performed several sets at comedy clubs after working all day. She discusses the added hazard of being a female having to perform in...dives. Can you imagine that walk from the club to her car in the early hours of the morning? She believes that safety is one of the contributing factors as to why there are not more female comedians. She talks about her heritage and her relationship with her extended family. Every immigrant family has an interesting story, and her parents are no exception. She is half Vietnamese and half Chinese, and those two cultures may seem similar in the eyes of many, but they actually have vast differences in philosophical approaches to life. Her husband is also half and half, and she describes their relationship as having the ‚Äúexact same amount of Asian.‚Äù They were both raised as Americans, but their Asian roots heavily influence who they are. Her husband writes an afterward, also addressed to their children, and he is pretty honest about his own personal journey dealing with being frequently the subject of his wife‚Äôs comedy. If she were making it all up or exaggerating the circumstances, that would certainly be less of a problem, but the issue, of course, is that she is sending arrows right into the bullseye. I love what he says about her. ‚ÄùAsian cultures often teach us to be silent about our sexuality and filled with shame. Your mother breaks that up and transmutes pain and shame into power, like a mystical priestess.‚ÄùSo as unlikely as I am to be an Ali Wong fan, I have to say it has happened. Yes, this book is hilarious, but it also touches on serious issues and, for this reader, even proves to be an inspiration. Keep chasing your dreams, work harder, and don‚Äôt give up. Few of us want to be as famous as Ali Wong, but most of us wish we could be more successful at something we love to do. Patience grasshopper. Wax on. Wax off.

The letters are hilarious, cautionary candid tales telling of Ali's life experiences from childhood through adulthood and cumulating into her becoming a mother. She is frank, candid, vulgar and hilariously real about all aspects of her life. She is not afraid to take risks and encourages her daughters to do so but to also learn from the mistakes their mother has made. Her book reads like her stand-up comedy specials (heck she mentions them enough in the book). She is fearless and really puts herself out there and pokes fun at her body, dating, her husband, having immigrants as parents, sex, food, pregnancy, and how taking risks paid off and made her a better person and stand-up comic. You do not need to be a fan of Ali Wong to read this book. I really didn‚Äôt know much about her prior to reading this one. I saw a couple of clips on YouTube of her performing while pregnant. If you were not a fan before this book, you will be after reading it. Unless you are turned off by talk of gapping buttholes and her multiple descriptions of her big bush. Seriously, someone needs to introduce this woman to laser hair removal or as least take her to get waxed. Just thinking out loud there.This book is fabulous although it seemed to stop on a dime. It just ended and then there was the afterword written by her husband to their two daughters. Overall, a hilariously funny, frank, raunchy, heartfelt and entertaining read. Thank you to Random House and NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Honestly, it cracked me up and made me smile!

It‚Äôs written as a letter to her two young little girls....with instructions: NOT TOBE READ UNTIL AGE 21! I loved this book... I loved reading about Ali.....*everything Ali*!!!We learn about Ali‚Äôs upbringing- and her personal life.... with love for her ‚Äòhandsome Asian husband‚Äô, and her two daughters...the heart-of-what-matters-most! A few excerpts below: ‚ÄúOne of the worst places I performed regularly at was‚ÄòOur Little Theater‚Äô. It literally seated eight people and was located in the heart of the Tenderloin district. That neighborhood was home to Southeast Asian refugees, a million drug addicts, and a truly remarkable amount of human feces on the street. There was no time to think about my set when walking to ‚ÄòOur Little Theater‚Äô because I was too busy trying not to get robbed and jumping over doo-doo and syringes on the sidewalk. That‚Äôs a game of hopscotch you ‚Äòneed‚Äô to win. Because if you lose, your consolation prize is ebola‚Äù. WORDS of WISDOM fromAli to her daughters:‚ÄúAt some point you gotta go. Mama loves you but it‚Äôs so important to get out of your hometown and get the fuck away from your family. As the youngest of four kids, I was always being observed by my siblings, who would judge my every decision. They had a set idea of who I was and it affected me. It was limiting. Everything I said generally had no credence because I was at least ten years younger than every single person in my family, so what did I know? When I got away from them, I finally felt like I could be the person I was meant to be, which just happened to be a person who talked about her wish to put nail polish remover in men‚Äôs buttholes so she could accomplish two things at once. Chances are that neither of you is also that person‚Äù. ‚ÄúMy family had always told me how to speak and how to feel about things. Part of what was so liberating about being on stage was that I could say whatever I wanted without having loved ones comment on it. Regardless of how the strangers would respond, at least they were strangers who didn‚Äôt know me or have any real authority over who I was. I loved the anonymity of my conversations with an audience‚Äù. Deciding to move to NYC after four years of doing stand up in San Francisco was hard for Ali. She was 26 at the time, and there were girls just out of college ordering her around who had nicer bags and shoes and she did‚Äù. ‚ÄúEvery day in NYC was about spending as little money as possible. I didn‚Äôt see any movies or eat out unless they went out on a date, or it was pizza or falafel. Ninety percent of the time I cooked at the SoHo loft. I‚Äôd buy lentils from a bulk bin at the East Village co-op and boil them to eat with salt, like a medieval peasant. And then I‚Äôd steam some vegetables from Chinatown. For three dollars and fifty cents, I found a place that sold half of a cooked chicken that was probably loaded with enough antibiotics to turn my blood into Purell‚Äù. ‚ÄúPretty much the worst thing about being a woman in stand-up is that you are always forced to socialize with male stand-up comics‚Äô girlfriends‚Äù. Comedy requires taking risks, and Ali takes them. She‚Äôs had nights of people yelling ‚Äòboo‚Äô. She learned from those devastating nights. She‚Äôs a comic that seriously works hard at her craft. She learned early to diversify her crowds. She said yes to every opportunity to do a set in other cities, even if it meant losing money. Ali gives advice to her daughters about stand-up...[don‚Äôt do it]...about men, dating, [men should pay on a first date], sex, pregnancy, family, [things she learned from her Vietnamese immigrant mother, siblings, etc.], shoes, [wear flats], about making mistakes [make them], and about the many choices they will make in their lifetime. Ali also shared with her daughters [ and us], shameful things she did in her youth. ....smoked her first cigarette at age 11. ....shoplifted lipstick ....‚ÄùOne New Years Eve when I was seventeen, I made out with thirteen boys and three girls. That‚Äôs basically an entire high school production of ‚ÄòOliver‚Äô‚Äù. ...etc. [she promised her daughters that things get way better after their teen years].How anyone can‚Äôt see Ali Wong‚Äôs greatness - her warm-hearted honest goodness - her gift to the world as an unguarded human being - is beyond me. Yep... I love Ali‚Äôs stand-up...And reading this book was a deeply pleasurable!! The last chapter, the Afterword, is written by Ali‚Äôs husband, Justin HakutaHe writes a letter to his girls...‚ÄúDear Mari and Nikki‚Äù.....Justin is mensch of a husband and father!!Looking forward to listening to the Audiobook! I can already imagine how enjoyable it will be to hear Ali read it!!Thank you Random House, Netgalley, and Ali Wong\n...more"

I love that she is a parent now, and I related to her stories a ton, even though our upbringing was completely different. I ate up the stories about how she met her husband and how he compared to the (multitude) of men she had dated in the past. She gave me the intimate content I was craving, and, no, I don't mean of her sex life (get your mind out of the gutter!).The second half of the book was a bit less funny and more of an exploration of her ethnic background, which I also enjoyed. Ali Wong showed me a lot about who she is and where she is going, both in her own journey to learn about herself and with her comedy. Sometimes, I think it's too early for a comedian to write a book, but with Ali Wong, it was just right. Both funny and poignant, Ali Wong really nailed it with Dear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets, and Advice for Living Your Best Life.*Copy provided in exchange for an honest review*goodreads|instagram|twitter|blog\n...more"

My full review goes into more detail about what did and didn't work for me.But if you're enjoying this book, quit while you're ahead, because the last chapter pops the illusion of candor and relatability like a day-old balloon.The final letter is actually from Wong‚Äôs husband, and it is so close to self-awareness. The chapter could have been thoughtful and confessional, but it doesn‚Äôt quite get there, and ends up a little irritating. The real disappointment, though, comes in the third-to-last paragraph of the book, when Justin Hakuta (Wong‚Äôs husband) drops this line:\n\"Who were we to take care of you and nurture such magical beings? But then instinct kicked in, along with relatives and Sofiya, your magical Ukrainian nanny, and we were off and running on our new adventure.\"\nThere‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a lot to unpack there, and I try to explain on my blog why this soured my experience of the book. It's not that I'm surprised that the family has a nanny, it's that it didn't occur to me that she was missing until the very end. For all her detailed descriptions of post-birth infection and breastfeeding pains, Wong never once mentions who is taking care of her children during the day. She spends an entire chapter talking about the experience of being a stay-at-home full-time parent while on maternity leave, and how taxing it was. She spends paragraphs praising her husband for being so involved even though he still works. Never once, in her ‚Äúunflinchingly honest‚Äù set of letters to her daughters, does Wong mention a woman instrumental in their upbringing. Celebrity memoirs require almost as much suspension of disbelief as novels. To enjoy them, you have to ignore the enormous impact of wealth and resources on the life of the person whose problems you're reading about. You have to look past everything that makes their life different to appreciate the moments when they're Just Like You. Even the most honest of memoirs are a magic trick.Ali Wong almost pulls it off... but if she wanted to seem relatable, she should have either been honest about the help she gets, or not mentioned it at all.

( Don‚Äôt worry! If you survived from any other Amy Schumer comedy specials, these jokes will be so much softer for your own taste! Oh and I adore dirty Schumer, too!) Being comedian, mocking yourself and loved ones, finding most creative and smartest jokes and being woman when you‚Äôre achieving that are the biggest challenges in the industry.

I just wrote the first names came into my mind) With those women‚Äôs talented brains, witty minds, creative, challenging, independent thoughts the world turns into a better place with more laughs, more fun and more vision!So I had amazing time by reading this book. I wish there would be more pages. I laughed so much and probably scared more neighborhood kids, dogs and squirrels. I highly recommend Ali Wong‚Äôs ‚ÄúHard Knock Wife‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaby Cobra‚Äù comedy specials. If you enjoy this book as much as I did, you won‚Äôt want to miss them and get ready to have so so so much fun!\n...more"

Instead it is fearless and real. Ali Wong says how we all feel:  I'm not fine.  Yet in her resilience and grit she is able to turn childhood resentment, male rejection, discrimination, getting boo'd offstage, the fear of a prenup, and a bushy pussy into the best things that could have happened to her. I laughed out loud as I imagined Ali's exaggerated comedy voice confessing life moments like this one when she was pregnant:After a while, I couldn't see my vagina when I looked down, because all I could see was my belly. But when I stared at myself in the mirror, my vagina just looked like an ancient wise Chinese man from a fairy tale that got stuck in a cave and survived off yams. The hair was so damn long and neglected. My nipples became progressively bigger and darker. One day I noticed the tips were starting to look a little scaly and naturally rubbed them. Some bits started to flake off like tiny brown boogers. And I just sat on the bathroom floor completely naked, with a garbage can between my thighs, picking at my nipples. Daddy walked in on me while I was completely focused on this important activity and asked , \"Are you harvesting your nipples?\" I didn't even look at him and just responded, \"Well, obviously.\"So many times I said YES I totally get that. It wasn't just because we shared a common Asian experience but often because we shared a common human experience. I applaud her courage in sharing so nakedly (sometimes literally nakedly so be prepared for some frank language).  Asian women live forever and having kids is like a 401(k) for companionship YES If a man rejects you once you've physically made a move on him, he's not going to change his mind. The dick don't lie. YES What I have in common with stay-at-home moms: We are all just doing our best. YES I've felt an increasing amount of jealousy and resentment from certain white male comics... I hear that line a lot: 'Me, I'm just another white guy.' Here's a solution: Try being a funnier white guy. YES It broke my heart. I said, 'This is torture. I can't handle this anymore. ' YES The most important part of parenting, relationships, pretty much anything - is just actually being there. YESA friend and I worried because in the intro Ali tries to set our expectations low about her writing. But while her prose isn't exquisite in that way where you can rhapsodize over gloriously minute details, it is weighted with truth which far exceeded my expectations. 5 stars. P.S. I have a secret hope that Ali and I are meant to be good friends, for her sister is also named Mimi and her best friend has half my name Miya. But wait would that make me superfluous? I am not too proud to be a 3rd Mimi.*My honest review was made possible by an Advanced Reader Copy thanks to Random House.*\n...more"

Okay. So I get that if you are Ali Wong, discussing your nanny (who you were able to hire because, again, you're rich) disrupts the narrative that you're ~just like the rest of us~ with career insecurities and family struggles and whatever. And I understand that it's difficult to walk the line of maintaining the authentic, crassly down-to-earth voice that's made you famous but also now you're famous. Still, it really made me re-think the whole book, and the clearly strategic choice to leave out discussion of the nanny. Somewhere during the (many) paragraphs where she's lauding her husband for somehow managing to co-parent their children despite having a job, she couldn't have thrown in a little bit of gratitude for the woman whose job it is to care for their children? It left a bad taste in my mouth and I knocked off a star because of it.\n...more"

I did love how this collection ended with a letter from her husband to their daughters too. The family seems very tight-knit, slightly manic at times, but ready to pull a knife on you if you screw with one of their own.I have to say that I found myself nodding along with Wong during parts of this essay to her daughters. I love what she had to say about marrying someone within their own culture and how it just makes things easier because you get things that someone else would not. I also loved her thoughts on traveling abroad to experience different people, countries, and food. All of the food mentioned in this book made me ridiculously hungry too by the way. When I traveled through Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Hong Kong years ago it felt like I finally came home. I ate everything I could and just went for whatever was put in front of me. I finally found countries that actually cooked food so hot it made the heat travel up through my ears. I was in heaven. Wong of course goes into how she met her now husband, how things were not perfect, still are not perfect, but they loved each other. It's also wonderful to see how she handles being the \"breadmaker\" in the family while he does things that are typically assigned to women. I think in America we still have that problem with men that stay at home are looked down upon by not only other people, but within their own families. Somehow stay at home husbands are not manly enough or something. But we don't say a word about how women are not womenly enough if they stay at home.Wong's family sounds completely chaotic and I loved the stories about her parents, her sisters, and her brother. We also get such great insights into the comedy circuit and how she forced herself out there to play in front of audiences that were diverse in order to get better. If you just play in front of the same crowd of white men and women, how are you stretching yourself and growing?Definitely would love to read another book from her in the future. \n...more"

Very refreshing.A short but very enjoyable look at everything from education to having your own family and juggling motherhood with a career on the road.

I understand why she makes those choices, but I don‚Äôt like it in men any more than I do in women. I‚Äôm not offended that a woman is saying these things. I just am not a big fan. I was still left wanting more after reading this book. I don‚Äôt think you get to know her any better from the book, than what you see up on stage. She says herself the those are just caricatures of real people. So I felt like I was reading a caricature of Ali Wong. Not getting to really know her.

Its still got that Chelsea brand of humor but she gets deep about privilege, politics, activism, drugs, family, and finding meaning in your life. It's really personal and probably won't appeal to every reader, but I enjoyed it. It made me think and made a great case for therapy being something for everyone. What...a delight."

That's not at all what I got. This book is a deep, introspective look at Chelsea Handler's life, shortcomings, and personality traits that make up the complex person that she is today. It is a serious story, and it's told very movingly and with much more vulnerability than I would have though Chelsea Handler to be capable of. If you have the chance to listen to this book in audio format, take it. I couldn't stop listening to Chelsea's voice, which ranges in tone from brazen to outraged to quivering with raw emotion. During the very meaty parts of the story, Chelsea is just opening crying while she reads. It was very enlightening listening experience for me. The story feels like a train of thought that never ends. It is like one long, gutting therapy session (at times, it is literally that). It humanized Chelsea Handler for me, who previously seemed chiefly just bawdy and tough. When I described the gist of the book to my husband, his immediate reaction was, Why would anyone listen to that? I'll admit, it's hard to describe the appeal of reading about a woman in her 40s examining her privilege, learning empathy for the first time, and digging deep into the reasons she is the way that she is. However, I found the audiobook to be addictive in a serious, contemplative way, and I had a hard time pressing pause. Go into this book looking for something different, not something funny or particularly entertaining. I found it to be a very worthwhile listening experience, and I know I'll be thinking about Chelsea Handler in a new light from now on. goodreads|instagram|twitter|blog\n...more"

Chelsea's a funny gal, but she takes a serious look at her life in this book - written as a result of a mid-life crisis triggered by Donald Trump's election. \"The news was giving me diarrhea\", Chelsea writes. \"The whole administration was giving me diarrhea. My outrage was high.\" Chelsea had a mid-life crisis after Trump's electionChelsea excoriates Trump as well as 'vampiric Ivanka and Jared', and 'Sarah Suckabee Sanders.' Chelsea is especially offended by the women in the Trump administration who do a disservice to their own gender.Chelsea acknowledges that she herself had a favored, successful life. Talented, pretty, Jewish, and driven, young Chelsea went to Hollywood and scored roles in movies and television before getting her own shows on E! and then Netflix. Teen Chelsea Handler was talented and prettyNevertheless, at the age of 42 Chelsea felt that something about her life was off, and - following Trump's ascendancy - decided to get therapy. Thus, Chelsea started seeing 'a real psychiatrist', Dr. Dan Siegel.Chelsea Handler's psychiatrist, Dr. Dan SiegelChelsea goes into detail about her therapy with Dan and recreates many of her conversations with the analyst. These sections are interspersed with anecdotes about Chelsea's life, some serious and some funny. At Dan's suggestion, Chelsea took the Enneagram personality test, which shows you which of nine personality categories you fit into. Chelsea decided she was a type 8 personality. \"Eights are self-confident, strong, assertive, protective, resourceful, straight-talking, and decisive, but they can also be ego-centric and domineering. Eights typically have problems with their tempers and with allowing themselves to be vulnerable. At their Best: eights use their strength to improve others' lives, becoming heroic, magnanimous, and inspiring.\" At their worst, eights are sociopaths. Chelsea observes that her dad and Donald Trump are also type 8 (I guess with Trump being on the sociopathic end of the scale.) Chelsea notes: \"The best way to describe my father is that he's a lot like Donald Trump but less successful, thank God, otherwise the damage he could have unleashed on innocent people could have been more widespread. Small Chelsea Handler and her father Melvin Chelsea calls her dad a 'shyster' and observes - not quite jokingly - that he sexually harassed all the black and Latina women in his orbit. During her analysis with Dan, Chelsea's epiphany comes when she realizes she hasn't properly dealt with the two biggest tragedies in her life: the death of her oldest brother Chet from a disastrous fall, and the death of her mother from cancer. Chelsea writes, \"My brother was the first man I ever slept with. The night I came home from the hospital my mom said that Chet, who was 13 at the time, asked if he could sleep with me....to which my mom agreed.\" Protective Chet had a rough night, though, since he worried about rolling over and crushing a two-day-old baby.Chelsea asserts, \"This gives you some insight into how interested my parents [Melvin and Rita Handler] were in raising children, or for that matter in using protection. They had 6 children and it's a miracle any of us are still breathing.\" Not to give the wrong impression, the Handlers loved their children, but had a laissez-faire attitude about rearing them. For instance, when pre-teen Chelsea walked into the house with a case of beer 'to try out', Rita just shrugged it off.Chelsea Handler's parents, Melvin and RitaChelsea adored her brother Chet. He would pull her from the covers and swing her in a circle; drive her around and let her listen to music; and take her sailing. On boating jaunts with his siblings, Chet always upset the skiff, dropping everyone in the water and making them laugh hysterically. Chelsea Handler's brother ChetWhen Chelsea was 9 and Chet was 22, the family - who lived in New Jersey - planned a trip to their vacation cottage in Martha's Vineyard. Chet decided to go hiking first, at the Grand Canyon, Zion Canyon, and then the Grand Tetons. Chelsea fussed, but Chet promised he'd come home in a couple of weeks and join the family. He never did. Grand Teton National Park in WyomingChet fell down a mountain in the Grand Tetons, and was killed. On top of her intense grief and sorrow Chelsea worried about the optics. \"Now everyone would know for sure our family was broken because now our family really WAS broken. We were already skating on thin ice because my parents were known to be less than traditional and a little bit too lackadaisical.....and now we had a dead brother because my parents let their son go hiking in the Grand Tetons and he had never hiked a mountain like that before. They were unfit, and now there was proof.\"Young Chelsea HandlerChelsea was bereft, and part of her continued to wait for Chet to return because he had promised he would. Moreover, the members of Chelsea's family withdrew into themselves, and she received no counseling or therapy. Thus, Chelsea's despair was locked up for decades, and deepened by her mother's illness. Chelsea Handler and her mother RitaChelsea's mom Rita had several bouts with cancer. During Rita's final illness, when Chelsea was about 30, her dad Melvin was useless. Melvin just mooned around the hospital and went out to get himself food. Meanwhile, Chelsea raised hell about her mother being in a hospital room with a smoker, and harassed the nurses for more pain meds for her mom. In accordance with her type 8 personality, Chelsea stepped up, as she ALWAYS did as an adult. Chelsea observes, \"There are things you can do for other people that you could never do for yourself. Whenever I have trouble standing up for myself.....and yes it has happened.....I think about whether I would tolerate the situation if it were happening to one of my sisters, mother, daughter, or niece. If it's not acceptable for them, it's not acceptable for me.\" Sadly, Chelsea's mother succumbed to the disease, adding to the comic's distress. Chelsea's therapy helped her work through the emotional impasse caused by her brother and mother's deaths.During her analysis with Dan, Chelsea also learned that - though she was good at sympathy - she lacked empathy. Chelsea couldn't understand the feelings of others, and had to work with Dan to overcome this flaw. In the end, Chelsea made a documentary about white privilege; began to respect other people's feelings; came to comprehend other peoples' limits and boundaries; learned more about the ubiquity of sexual harassment; and so on.On the lighter side, Chelsea talks about her cherished pets, an assortment of chow mix rescue pooches.\"Loving a dog makes you a kinder and fuller person\" Chelsea says. Her 'first born' was Chunk, a regal hound who accompanied Chelsea to work and on her travels. Chelsea Handler and ChunkThen came Tammy, who'd survived more than one street fight and showed it. \"Tammy had one dead ear, alopecia on her ass, a very scantily clad tail, and a gait that hinted she had sustained hip replacement surgery.\" Chelsea remarks, \"I knew that with some maternal attention from my cleaning ladies and some serious nutrition I could turn that gait into a swagger.\" Chelsea Handler and TammyTammy (reluctantly) endured Chelsea's aggressive love for years until she went to doggie heaven. After Tammy's demise, Chelsea got two more chow mixes, a brother and sister called Bert and Bernice. Chelsea Handler with Bert and BerniceTales about these two, especially Bert, are hilarious. Chelsea observes, \"Burt has all the trappings I look for in a pet: long hair, weight management issues and laziness behind the eyes. Bert is slow on the uptake and is constantly confused by the same things he has done moments before. His memory is so short term that if I'm gone for a few hours, I have to re-introduce myself every time I come home. The dirty looks he throws my way when I try to gain re-entry into his world are so full of disdain that sometimes I don't even have the stomach for it.\" Though Bert dismisses Chelsea's attempts at affection, he's smitten with Chelsea's Mexican housekeeper Mama and follows her everywhere. If Mama strolls away swinging her behind, Bert is right behind doing the same thing. Chelsea admits that, when Bert hides under the table, she tricks him into coming out by using a Mexican accent. To add insult to injury, Bert's sister Bernice plays dead when Chelsea approaches.When Bert had to go on veterinarian-ordered diet, Chelsea came home after being away for five days and found Bert and Mama strutting around the house, both wearing ankle weights - two for Mama and four for Bert. Chelsea laments, \"Bert and Mama had started their very own weight loss challenge and guess who didn't get the group text.\" In another dog story, Chelsea writes about giving Chunk human sedatives during a plane trip, a mistake that resulted in one calamity after another. (It's a wonder the duo were ever allowed on an aircraft again. üòä ) Chelsea Handler and Chunk on a planeIn other vignettes, Chelsea talks about her technological ignorance; her attraction to hunky Robert Mueller; a journey to Peru to take the hallucinogenic drug ayahuasca; the (inadvertently amusing) problems associated with burying her Mormon mother in a Jewish cemetery; her father's bypass surgery; her father's death; her marijuana expertise; and more. Chelsea Handler with her father MelvinChelsea winds up by detailing 'The year I became me.' In the end, Chelsea put her money where her mouth is, gave up her Netflix show, and went out to get more women elected. Chelsea Handler announced she was leaving her Netflix showThe book is worth reading, both to learn about Chelsea's healing journey, and to her enjoy her wit and humor.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot....\n...more"

I think this book does reflect the changes in how she views herself, her family, and the world in general now that she is in her 40s.

I‚Äôve ultimately decided to go with the full five-stars, simply because I was so damn impressed by this whole memoir, not only in terms of content and execution, but also in terms of the extremely honest and raw narration Chelsea Handler delivered on the audio edition.Now, granted, I‚Äôve never read one of Chelsea‚Äôs books before, nor have I watched any of her shows or seen her stand-up performances, so I have nothing to compare this to. Up until now, to me, she was just this opinionated, no-holds-bar, American comedienne ‚Äì one I was fairly sure I only really knew about because she was friends with Jennifer Aniston and had some strong-ass opinions on Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency.So, how did I get here? I became intrigued by Chelsea‚Äôs story after listening to her and her sister (Shoshanna) guest star on Kate and Oliver Hudson‚Äôs podcast, Sibling Revelry, where they deep-dived into their childhoods, discussing their relationships with each other and their often-complicated relationships with their parents. I was so fascinated by what they had to say and how insightful and self-aware they seemed to be while saying it, that I couldn‚Äôt help but be compelled to read this memoir.Here, Chelsea shares everything, from accounts of hilarious travel adventures and anecdotes of her rescue dogs getting up to all sorts, through to the personality impacting, decades-old death of a worshipped older brother and her (sometimes messy) relationships with each of her parents. All of this she tells through the lens of her recent sessions with her psychiatrist, Dr. Dan Siegel, which just added to the originality of the memoir. As I mentioned, this was an extremely honest and raw narration, with Chelsea even breaking down and crying through several points of this emotional and astute self-reflection. Yet, through all the emotional stuff, Chelsea still delivered her trademark sardonic sense of humour and provided an amusing, authentic glimpse into her complex psyche.Needless to say, Chelsea Handler is on my radar now, in a whole new way, and I look forward to exploring more of her work going forward. \n...more"

One which I must say sounds (at the age of 42ish) all grown up!After the 2016 election of Donald Trump, Handler basically fell apart. But she had no idea why. During her recent Netflix series, Chelsea, she interviewed a psychiatrist, Dan Siegel and decided to make him her therapist. Thus began her year long self-analysis journey into why she is the Chelsea Handler she has been.Although the book covers serious subject matter, Handler does add her flair for the one liners, sarcasm and hysterical observations.One such story is how she became to have a crush on Robert Mueller! She knows he‚Äôs married!Through her analysis she primarily learns that she has never really gotten over her brother Chet‚Äôs sudden death when she was very young and because she never fully accepted the death, she has had many unattainable relationship goals as well as significant issues when dealing with death. Chet‚Äôs death impacted her whole immediate family and each sibling and parent dealt with it very differently, something a young girl at the time was hardly able to understand.Life Will Be the Death of Me is a quick read filled with humor, sadness, love and a message to everyone who has had to go through what she has had to.

Many artists have interacted with Shakespeare in playful, modern ways, but I don't know of anyone else who's fully tried to mimmick the bard's own writing. Doescher does it masterfully, giving us literary nerds all the inside joke humor we could dream of while also crafting some truly deep, moving lines. Well done!

A good knowledge of Mean Girls is quite helpful, but I have to say that even though it's been some time since I've seen it, it came back instantly and the story told it well.I wasn't entirely sure how well Mean Girls would translate into Shakespeare, but honestly, it worked so well. The writing and the formats of the asides/coming in and out of the balconies were amazing. It totally worked well with the drama and the classic, iconic quotes in Shakespeare's language was so amazing. Shakespeare has never been a huge for thing for me since I haven't always been able to figure out what he was saying. However, Doescher did such a great job for making Shakespeare accessible and interesting for those that aren't the biggest Shakespeare fan. It's also such a quick read that still allows you for investment in the story and characters. While this was funny, I never fully got laugh out loud funny for me. I think I was so focused on trying to read the Shakespeare type writing. That was the only thing that kept me from being fully into it for a five crown read.

How do you get them to understand the idea of iambic pentameter, or get them introduced to the way that Shakespearean language sounds, or how it looks on the page? Well, if you're Ian Doescher, you take classic films and rewrite them into plays that read exactly as they would if the Bard himself had written them.Many students actively resist the idea of studying Shakespeare. They think that his plays are boring, and difficult to understand. They don't see the point. I believe that at least a part of this stems from the fact that they don't know HOW to read Shakespeare. Doescher's books can help to rectify that. By telling stories that students are already familiar with in Shakespeare's style, these books can provide a gateway into the way that Shakespearean literature is written. That in turn can make it easier for students to understand Shakespeare's actual plays. Highly recommend that any teen and any school librarian keep a copy of both the books in Doescher's William Shakespeare's Star Wars series, as well as this book and future books that he may write in this series on hand. I think that they may prove themselves useful as not only a form of entertainment, but also as a teaching aide.Reader: I am not a fan of Mean Girls. Never have been, probably never will be, frequent humming of \"I'd Rather Be Me\" from the Mean girls musical notwithstanding. I just have never been all that in to Teen/High School movies. I knew that going in. However, I am a HUGE fan of Ian Doescher's Willam Shakespeare's Star Wars series. as well as his delightful Shakespearean retelling of A Christmas Carol. I also knew that going in. So the question became, could Doescher transform a story I'd never really cared for into a book that I enjoyed reading? The answer is yes. Mostly. Oh, I still don't love the plot. And much like his Star Wars series, there is tendency to rely slightly too heavily on Shakespeare references and jokes. Those jokes can way the text down slightly, as they require the reader to have a decent level of familiarity with Shakespeare's plays. If the reader doesn't have that familiarity, much if the humor could be lost. Still, it's a good book, if slightly uneven feeling. I don't love it, but I did enjoy it. And I suppose that's good enough.Reading Challenge: 52 Weeks - Week #5: A Play\n...more"

Fetch shall never catch.Stop hosting an event no one attends.\"The bard may be enough to make people groan but taking this beloved classic and applying modern mores actually makes you understand the film better as well as teasing the reader into finding out more about Shaespeare.The plays of England's most well known and revered writer were made for as wide an audience as possible, they were made to be watched and enjoyed en masse, they were not the remit of the rich and privileged. In his books, Ian Doescher is bridging the gap by exploring the modern phenomenons of cliques, high school adolescence and peer pressure by comparing it to, amongst others, ''Much Ado About Nothing',¬†'The Tempest, and¬†'Romeo And Juliet'.Whilst laughing at Sheakespeare-d classic lines of dialogue, the reader is taking in the features of the writing (for example, iambic pentameter and the Shakespearean sonnet) so whilst it does not take long to read, this short book leaves a lasting impression.I for one¬†loved it and am very much looking forward to¬†'MacTrump'!\n...more"

No adaptations, no new interpretations, it was too literal. I LOVE the movie, and maybe I'm just comparing this to the musical- which DID reinterpret something, and bring new ideas, characteristics, and some female feminism to the table. This book obviously took a lot of work and commitment to write, but I wanted something MORE.

It is the book I never knew I always wanted. A hilarious modern movie meets my love of Shakespeare? Perfect! And frankly, it really is kind of perfect. If you've seen Mean Girls, you know the plot (the connection of Much Ado specifically is pretty tenuous). The book seems to follow the movie very closely. So the charm is in the language, and how it brings Mean Girls' plot to life in a whole new light. The author did an excellent job capturing Shakespearean-sounding language, and the characters, in all their catty, shallow glory, were well suited to Shakespearean treatment. I wasn't always sure about how he incorporated quotations from Shakespeare's plays into the work--sometimes they worked better than others. But mostly they worked well, and the author explains some of his rationale for their inclusion in an charming afterward, wherein he also waxes poetical about his gratitude to the women in his life and of his admiration of Tina Fey. Such a refreshing lack of toxic masculine posturing. This was just a wonderful, cheerful way to unwind at the end of the day. If you have come to see some of the problematic racial elements of Tina Fey's style of comedy, you will unfortunately still see them in this story. But that is a critique of the original writing, not of the loving recreation of it in this book. If you enjoy Shakespeare, even without having experienced Mean Girls, I think you could enjoy this. If you've enjoyed both Shakespeare AND Mean Girls, get thee to a bookstore as soon as this is released!(Thank you Netgalley for letting me read an advanced copy.)\n...more"

I follow him on twitter and I am told his Instagram is hilarious. He constantly amazes me with his outrageously odd tweets.I have also followed his career. As a producer and writer on Family Guy, the original Will & Grace, to being the executive producer and creator of Vicious, a hysterical show about an English couple, Freddie and Stuart, who have been together for over 50 years and their love/hate relationship with each other and their small group of quirky friends, he has certainly left his mark. So with all that said, I was excited to read his book of essays, Do You Mind If I Cancel. But what I soon discovered was that Janetti had an extremely lonely childhood, who had no friends at school, who would run home after school to eat lunch (as there was no one to each lunch with at school) and watch a soap opera One Life to Live, one which he continued to watch until its end over 30 years later. He relied on his incredible imagination to keep him occupied and to drive his mother crazy!He made his first friend while attending college at Hofstra University, where he also had his first relationship. After college he became a \"writer\" in name only. He said he was one, but never seemed to get around to being one. He was just waiting for the right time. To supplement his \"writing\" career he took on odd jobs. He was a receptionist, he did bike tours for American teenagers through Europe, but he spent most of his twenties as an overnight bellhop at a hotel in New York. Essays also include his undying love for Patti Lupone, visiting the One Life to Live set as a child, traveling as a young boy and falling in love for the first time.Although the pieces are funny and unconventional, as I believe he really is, there is also a feeling of sadness, loss, a missing out during his childhood, something I think we can all identify with to a certain degree.And of course there was his moment of realization in which the soon to be thirty year old Janetti moves from being a \"writer\" to becoming an accomplished writer and producer and never looking back. Until now.\n...more"

It was just all of a sudden over. Once again,without rhyme or reason.It bothered me how often Janetti seemed to pigeonhole gay men. Like, all gay men must be exactly like him. And yet most of the time he didn't even seem to like the parts of him he was describing. It made no sense to me. Also, if he brought up how supposedly attractive he is/was one more time, I might have thrown the book away. I get it, you think you're all that and a bag of chips.The more I think about it, the more annoyed I get. It was just all so repetitive and mediocre.

It's snarky and hilarious, and I love it so much. And, he's married to Brad Goreski. So obviously I needed to see what was up. Janetti's trademark humor is certainly here. His humor is sarcastic and wry, which is often my favorite kind. The kind that's subtle enough that you could easily miss something hilarious if you're not paying attention. I couldn't help, at one point, comparing him to David Sedaris. The comparison isn't exactly right, but I do think there are hints of Sedaris here. I do think Janetti tended to focus inward a bit more, perhaps? There are certainly outside observations, but the primary focus of these essays is on Janetti himself, and some of the landmark moments of his own life. It's interesting because I went into this for the humor, and there's a ton of it, oozing from each essay. But, there are some some really raw moments and emotions behind that humor, which I think compounds the more you read. The themes begin to show, the way the stories connect. Janetti jumps around a bit in time period - shifting from him in grade school to him just after college, bach to high school, etc. But by the end, these are all pieces of a puzzle that seem to fit together just right. Earlier moments and stories become more clear or meaningful as you continue to read, and jump back to an earlier time period again. The more you get to know Janetti - especially the Janetti in these pages, the one that was searching and growing and desperately looking for his place - the more meaningful stories about going to great lengths to play sick in grade school become. Life is hard, and Janetti doesn't exactly shy away from addressing how hard it can be, especially for a gay man coming of age in the 80s, but he does mask some of that hardship behind humor, and cuts the sharpness of the pain behind these stories in the way he tells them and very carefully orders them. I really loved his final essay in particular - because it really brought everything up to that point together. Him, in this gay club, realizing that his younger years are behind him. There is so much present in that essay, including this subtle but incredibly powerful acknowledgement of the AIDS crisis in the 80s, something he was on the periphery of without probably totally realizing it at the time. There is this sense of an immense sadness as well as a crisis averted. I just really enjoyed this book. It gave me a newfound respect for Janetti, and further appreciation for his talent with storytelling, the subtlety and power of his skill. \n...more"

Yet it‚Äôs such a short book and I was really hoping for greater depth. Or maybe more humor? I love and follow the author‚Äôs Instagram account where he has endless hilarious parody posts about Prince George, imagining him as a young gay boy. Gary Janetti is hilarious. At least in internet meme form. In the book? There‚Äôs some fun lines that made me crack a smile but that was basically it. Yet as I said, I really did enjoy the stories. I wasn‚Äôt fully sure what I was getting going into this and I‚Äôm still unsure what exactly to call it. Not quite a memoir because it‚Äôs told out of order. More vignettes, a gay male version of say Sandra Cisneros The House on Mango Street though that‚Äôs giving the book too much credit. I was a weird gay kid too, a lesbian who must have been a gay male in another life. So I was most amused, perhaps, by the similarities. It also reminded me a great deal of my gay male best friend (Hi Chris!). One of my favorites was the piece on Patti Lupone and a young Gary‚Äôs profound excitement at attending Evita on Broadway for the first time. I liked his letter to a younger version of himself and the youth hostel biking trip he lead through Europe.Yet... the essays or pieces were kind of shallow, never quite as deep as they could‚Äôve been while never as funny as I expected and I think I would‚Äôve been thrilled with one or the other. The very last chapter where he mentions his sister‚Äôs job in a gay bar when he was 16, how much he looked up to those men, and then finding out a few years later they had all died, early AIDS victims was perhaps the most poignant. Still we kind of gloss over the real feeling. Gary mentions how much he would go back and instead of being shy and awkward, Shake their hands and thank them. There‚Äôs also a heartbreaking line where he writes how seemingly no one cares or noticed much, that gay men were disposable. How much more could this piece have been if he‚Äôd explored both those thoughts a little more. How much better could this book have been if it had been twice as long, with real heart and soul? I imagine other LGBT and especially gay men may enjoy this one. I‚Äôm not sure many other people would get much from it. Most of the book is on Gary‚Äôs late teens to mid and late 20s and I think this worked so well for me since I‚Äôm less than two weeks away from my own 30th birthday and reflecting a lot on my life, on growing up (since my G-d, I really must be an adult now, right?), wondering where the time went and how radically different my life is, in ways good and bad, from what I ever would‚Äôve imagined at 16. So there‚Äôs something worthwhile here. I just wanted more. \n...more"

Also many stories of his travels and adventures in romance as a young gay man who didn't come out til later than you'd expect.

Along the way, I picked up a few pointers, chuckled a few times, and pretty much liked the essays presented.You can't be a Southern lady though without the term \"Bless your heart\" a phrase that has more meaning and innuendo then I ever imagined. Sadly though it was missing in these essays, but that being said the bits and pieces we learn about Southern ladies was cute and full of whimsy. While some of the essays made me chuckle, there were some that seemed to fall a bit on the not so funny side for this Southern lady. However, on the whole this collection is a good way to while away one's time on the beach or traveling.Jan and I read this one and are interested in looking into this author's other stories.

We bless hearts and sip sweet tea and smile sweetly as we mention that your outfit is so daring, we could never pull that off. This is not good southern humor. This doesn't even come close to good southern humor. I believe Helen Ellis is probably a fantastic oral story teller. When you tell a funny story in person, you get to embellish, make hand gestures, enunciate different words. The presentation of a funny story is far more important than the story itself. In person, maybe the story of Helen accidentally mistaking someone else's $800 coat for her own $800 coat is hysterical. But there's no umph to this story. She calls two people, confirms it's not their coat, then she and her husband go to a store to buy a $1200 coat to make her feel better about her belief that the coat she has is not her own. This story is a lot of things, but funny isn't one of them. Same for the story of a friend's husband's tale of a three-way he witnessed. That sounds like an amazing set up, but too much time is spent dissecting the husband's story telling method, and the wife's response to hearing the same story repeatedly. That is not humor. It's barely story telling in itself. The only story I enjoyed was Serious Women, wherein Helen sits in the courtroom while her friend prosecutes a woman who murdered a former high school classmate and cut her baby out, pretending it was hers. There was no humor in this story. There wasn't supposed to be. And the story telling itself wasn't particularly good. But I kept thinking, \"Damn, did someone write a book about this? Because I would read it.\" Then I set this book down and started googling the news story. This is not a good book. There's no Southern Lady Code word for that. It's just bad. \n...more"

I do like a good collection of diverse humorous essays, and this is one of those books.Ellis, an Alabama native now residing in New York City, references the 'Southern Lady Code' in most of her twenty-plus succinct compositions. Said 'Code,' which she learned from her mother who is also named Helen (and who I imagine to sound like the late great actress Dixie Carter, best known from TV's Designing Women and Family Law), is being sort of diplomatic or at least less verbally blunt using a certain phrase or phrasing. (For example: 'put together,' in regards to clothing - \"You can take me to church or a [chain restaurant] and I'll fit in just fine.\" More honey, less vinegar - got it?) Ellis riffs on all sorts of subjects - marriage, health issues, etiquette, and a particularly memorable 13th birthday party. Possibly my favorite - and there were only one or two duds in the line-up - was the penultimate and uncommonly serious 'Serious Women,' in which she shadowed a friend she greatly respects, an assistant district attorney who is prosecuting a shocking kidnapping / murder case.\n...more"

However, the audio led to a mortifying situation for me, and I'm (completely unfairly) rounding my rating down rather than up for that. What happened was this... I had about an hour left of book and decided to listen to it at the hair salon, where I was getting my color rejuvenated. I had my wireless earbuds in and everything was going fine until my stylist bumped an earbud while wrapping foil around a strand of hair. I was on the chapter called \"An Emily Post for the Apocalypse,\" in which Ellis talks about her mother's advice on what a lady should do in various outrageous situations. At the moment my earbud was bumped, which caused the audio to stop transmitting through the buds and start blaring through my phone's speaker, she was describing what one does when one comes home and finds a repairman mast*****ing in one's living room. There was dead silence in the salon. \"Awkward\" falls utterly short. And if Ellis's mother had a trick for smoothing over the unexpected broadcast of what sure sounded like a filthy book in a peaceful salon, Ellis didn't include it here.Anyway, this is quick and moderately amusing.\n...more"

In terms of the ‚Äúcode,‚Äù I thought I‚Äôd be reading straight satire, but discovered that she has provided a combination of self-help tips and searing, sometimes raucous humor. It works surprisingly well. I have never made a cheese log before or wanted one, but Ellis‚Äôs recipe sounds so persuasively delicious that I may try it. That said, my favorite essays were short on advice and long on humor. I nearly hurt myself laughing over the construction man she found masturbating in her bedroom‚Äîdid I mention that she gets a little edgy here? And ‚ÄúThe Ghost Experience‚Äù is massively entertaining. There‚Äôs a lot of good material. Though at times her outlook is a little more conservative than my own, I like the things she says in support of gay and trans friends. Ultimately, I suspect that I am not the target audience for Ellis, who in her middle-aged years is dispensing life skills wrapped in bountiful amounts of humorous anecdotes. She is writing to her peers and to those women younger than herself. I am ten or twenty years older than this woman, but I still came away impressed. So, ladies and women, if you can look past the assumption of a greater-than-average income, you‚Äôll have a good time here, and if you can‚Äôt, try to get this collection at the library and read selectively, because more of these essays will resonate than not, for all of us.

I say \"should' because it is supposed to snow across most of North America this week and dumb because, hello? Who wakes up before the sun rises on purpose!?! :) Yes, I love birds. I adore them. I feed them and attract them and I really do have a backyard wildlife habitat. Like the book, The Field Guide to Dumb Birds of North America, I'm just being cheeky. Matt Kracht has written a very funny, tongue in cheek guide to some of the most common birds found in North America. He has humorously renamed them so that we might easily remember them. For example, there is the White Breasted Butt Nugget, the Western Meadow Jerk or, simply, the damn crows. He tends to feel about crows the same way I do. The entire page is filled with Caw, Caw, Caw, Caw, Caw..... Yes, that really is all that you need to know about the damn crow, isn't it? Kracht also accompanies each delightful paragraph of information with his own personal illustrations. Okay, some are better than others depending on how well he likes the bird. I won't even show you the illustration of the crow which resembles something a two year old with a black marker might draw in a fit of rage. Again, very aptly done when considering the caw-caw-caw of the crow. Most, however, are beautifully rendered.Despite the irreverence, the information throughout the book, the details, the drawings - with a few noted exceptions - the maps, and the highlights are very informative. If I were teaching children about birds.... okay, well, there is some mild cursing but aside from that, I can assure you that kids definitely would remember these birds better than they would a regular field guide. Absolutely! I know that I will! It also makes for a terrific coffee table book and conversation piece. Guests have adored it! I adore it!

And their prominence has led to the development of a specific kind of person: the birdwatcher. Now there‚Äôs a guide for new or expert birders interested in perfecting the favorite pastime of ‚Ä¶ sitting and watching birds.The tone of this book is set with the title: The Field Guide to Dumb Birds of North America. Author Matt Kracht obviously has an interesting relationship these animals, and his blunt attitude stretches beyond the cover. Each bird featured includes a notation about their common name, but Kracht also renames them. The White-Breasted Butt Nugget (White-Breasted Nuthatch) and the Western MeadowJerk (Western Meadow Lark) both make appearances, among a flock of fifty. Some of these work better than others, but they all serve for Kracht to degrade what he considers flying monstrosities.Beyond just the names, this book is wickedly funny. Kracht embodies an individual with absolute disdain for all things bird. In his world, their only functions are to make annoying noises and steal food, and he won‚Äôt hear a word otherwise. Yes, it‚Äôs over the top, but Kracht mocks with absolutely infectious glee, almost goading the reader to challenge his view on why these aviary creatures suck.Even with all the snark, Kracht is careful to load up on facts. He describes their calls, migratory patterns, markings, and includes accurate illustrations. However, it‚Äôs the sections that bookend the guide that are both insightful and suggest Kracht might have a softer side when it comes to birds. Here, he discusses the art of birding, picking proper bird feeders, as well as maintaining a bird jounal. His style of ridiculing the hobby and the animal is still on display, but it almost appears to stem from a deep admiration‚Äî he‚Äôs too cool for bird watching ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs still fun.It‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs crass, and as a particularly annoying bird would say, ‚ÄúCaw!

Experienced birders, bird-lovers, or people who birders are trying to convert? I couldn't quite figure it out.I like a good joke or pun but I'm not the biggest fan of toilet humour/swearing for swearing's sake, which got really repetitive in this book. How many times can you work the word \"butt\" into a funny name for a bird? It got boring. I wish they'd had someone do a punch up on this book because it could have been a lot funnier instead of the same jokes over and over. Birds are really funny and weird and ALREADY have ridiculous dirty-sounding names (bushtit, woodcock, woodpecker) and I don't think the author capitalized on that enough. It felt lazy.I am all for using ridiculous pneumonics, and the silly bird names in this book probably would be helpful for newer birders to remember names but instead of just inserting \"butt\" or \"shit\" into random bird names I think they could have tried harder to make the silly names actually descriptive and representative of the bird's appearance or behaviour. One really great example where they did do this was the limpkin (\"limpdick\") entry, but it wasn't consistent. If this was meant to be an introductory field guide I don't understand why the addition of info like habitat, behaviour, identifying characteristics was only included for some birds and not all. They had room to do it, didn't make sense why it was only on some pages and not others. Also there was some general bad editing throughout (typos, missing words, etc.).Things I liked - the parts where the author toned down the toilet humour and made it a bit more subtle (intro, end chapters). The drawings are legit awesome. The idea of this book was a brilliant one, but poorly executed in my opinion. If I had someone to illustrate for me and like, a book deal, I honestly think I could have written this better.

I found it to be a pleasant mixture of eloquence and sarcasm, humor and wit.

[Warning: strong language.]Even though you are unlikely to have considered the question before now, you probably already know whether or not you'd enjoy a profane bird guide. I love the idea; the title and the cover art had me laughing right away. The hand-drawn art is beautiful throughout, and the author's love for birds and birding is clear, despite his ostensibly hostile tone. After a while, though, the joke felt repetitive to me. I think I might prefer to read an alternate-universe edition hewing more closely to the present cover design, with a specific focus on the low intelligence demonstrated by the birds' (fictional) behavior.Each bird gets a two-page spread, pairing a full-page illustration with an insulting name, followed by a common name that explains away the joke. (Isn't it enough to describe the \"Red-winged Buttwad\" without clarifying that most people have traditionally called this a Red-winged Blackbird?) Maybe one could wish for more from the names, but I had fun arranging them along a continuum of antipathy: Dumb Western Bluebird, Dumb-Ass Robin, Stupid-Ass Steller's Jay, Damn Crows, Goddamn Song Sparrow, Goddamned Canada Goose, Fucking Pigeon, Motherfucking Bald Eagle. (In fact, the eagle probably belongs at the other extreme.)A paragraph or two of text identifies the defining features of each species, and expresses the author's disdain for it. Often, this is pretty funny. See under \"Red-winged Buttwad,\" for example: \"Southern and some lazy western populations don't migrate at all. Interestingly, who cares, because they're already everywhere.\" Or under \"Great Blue Moron:\" \"[I]t's always trying to choke some giant fish down its stupid neck. There are plenty of other fish that would fit.\"Extra sections offer tips on bird-watching. Ordinarily, I wouldn't be in the market for that advice, but it's made more palatable by the author's casual cynicism.I have to mention that the editors missed a couple of things along the way, including the substitution of \"who's\" for \"whose\" twice in a single sentence.\n...more"
